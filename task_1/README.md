# Image Classification with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## Description
This project demonstrates an image classification model implemented using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Python. It utilizes machine learning techniques to classify images into different categories.

## Features
- Uses OOP concepts to structure the code.
- Implements image preprocessing and model training.
- Supports multiple image classes for classification.
- Provides a structured and reusable approach to image classification.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/swordfish2110/winstar_ai_task
   ```
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Ensure Jupyter Notebook is installed and run the notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Usage
- Open `Image_classification_+_OOP.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
- Execute the cells step by step to preprocess images, train the model, and classify images.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- TensorFlow / PyTorch (depending on the model used)
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
